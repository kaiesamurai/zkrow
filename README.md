# zkPass Configured Privacy Dapp on Nibiru Chain

Welcome to the zkPass Privacy Dapp repository configured for Nibiru Chain! This Dapp leverages zkPass technology integrated with Nibiru Chain to enable secure and private data verification within decentralized applications.

## Overview

This Dapp utilizes zkPass, a privacy-preserving technology, to verify sensitive user data such as account balances, KYC information, and transaction histories without revealing personal details. Integrated with Nibiru Chain, it ensures robust security and transparency in data verification processes.

## Features

- **Privacy-Preserving Verification**: Allows users to verify account balances and KYC status through zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) on Nibiru Chain, ensuring confidentiality.
  
- **Secure Data Handling**: Utilizes Nibiru Chain's decentralized infrastructure for secure and tamper-proof data verification, enhancing trust and reliability.
  
- **Easy Integration**: Seamless integration into decentralized applications (Dapps) powered by Nibiru Chain, enabling developers to implement privacy-focused data verification with ease.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**: Clone this repository to your local environment:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name
   cd zkpass-nibiru-dapp
   ```

2. **Configuration**: Follow setup instructions to configure zkPass and Nibiru Chain integration:
   - Update configurations in `config.js` with your zkPass credentials and Nibiru Chain endpoints.
   - Set up cryptographic keys and configure network parameters as per documentation.

3. **Integration**: Integrate zkPass privacy features into your Dapp:
   - Use zkPass SDK to initiate zero-knowledge proofs for verifying user data.
   - Implement frontend components and backend services to handle zkPass requests securely.

4. **Deployment**: Deploy the Dapp on Nibiru Chain:
   - Ensure all configurations are correctly set for deployment.
   - Test functionality and performance in a sandbox environment before production deployment.

## Usage

- **User Verification**: Users can securely verify their account balances, KYC information, and transaction history through the Dapp without disclosing sensitive details.
  
- **Developer API**: Provides APIs for integrating zkPass features into existing Nibiru Chain applications, enhancing privacy and security.
